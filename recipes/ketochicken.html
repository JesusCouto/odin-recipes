    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This keto chicken thigh recipe is sure to become a favorite. Crispy pan-fried, bone-in chicken thighs are topped
        with bacon, mushrooms, green onions, and a creamy sauce.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4(8 ouce) skin-on,bone-in chicken thighs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>4 slices bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces</li>
        <li>⅓ cup low-sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>4 ounces sliced mushrooms</li>
        <li>¼ cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>2 green onions, white and green parts separated and sliced</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Season chicken thighs on all sides with paprika, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Cook bacon in a cast iron skillet or oven-safe pan over medium-high heat until browned, 4 to 5 minutes.
            Remove from skillet and drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Drain and discard excess grease from the
            skillet.</li>
        <li>Return the skillet to medium heat and cook chicken thighs, skin-side down, for 3 to 4 minutes. Flip chicken
            over and place the skillet in the preheated oven.</li>
        <li>Bake until chicken thighs are no longer pink at the bone and juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An
            instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove chicken to
            a plate and cover with foil to keep warm. Remove all but 2 tablespoons of drippings from the skillet.</li>
        <li>Return the skillet to the stove over medium-high heat. Pour in chicken broth while whisking up brown bits
            from the bottom of the skillet. Add mushrooms and cook until soft, about 3 to 4 minutes. Pour in heavy
            whipping cream and whisk together until lightly simmering, then reduce heat to medium-low. Season with salt
            and pepper, if necessary.</li>
        <li>Return chicken and any juices back into the skillet; top with bacon and green onions. Serve immediately,
            spooning sauce over chicken.</li>
    </ol>
